   - Web Application: https://localhost:7220

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### .NET Aspire Best Practices
- **Always** use .NET 9+ for new projects (never .NET 8)
- **Always** use `dotnet run --project AppHost` for orchestration
- **Always** implement health checks with `/health` endpoints
- **Always** use service discovery for inter-service communication
- **Always** follow the AppHost-first architecture pattern

### Code Standards
- Follow C# coding conventions and use nullable reference types
- Use Entity Framework Core with proper migrations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Add comprehensive unit tests for new features
- Use Tailwind CSS for UI components (maintain design consistency)

### Architecture Patterns
- Microservices with .NET Aspire orchestration
- Service defaults for shared configurations
- Azure-ready with Container Apps deployment patterns
- Modern UI with Blazor and Tailwind CSS
- AI integration patterns for content generation
